Aug 2020 – May 2024

### Academic Project
Final Year Project – (Industrial collaboration with PreciX Ptd Ltd) (Ongoing)

Project Title: Design and develop software modules to enhance automatic sensor data processing for Biomechanics Applications.

• Analyzed and identified bottlenecks in the data processing workflow, and administered solutions through            software solution design.

• Proposed innovative approaches to reduce processing time, minimize steps, and enhance user experience.

• Fine-tuned pre-trained YOLOv8 model for bone detection in ultrasound images.

Medical Device Design - Solution for aphasia patients

• Sourced, analyzed and pre-processed open-source EEG data into suitable input shape to be fed as training data      for machine learning.

• Contributed to creating and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.

• Explored different pre-processing techniques such as ICA and PCA in EEG signal processing.

• Involved in proposing ideas and report writing to help consolidate and present the novel application of our        project which aims to aid aphasia patients to communicate better.

Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Data Analysis - Resale flat prices in Singapore

• Cleaned, handled, and analyzed a dataset consisting of more than 120000 rows of data using Jupyter Notebook.

• Utilized linear regression model and machine learning models to predict future resale flat prices.

• Summarized our findings and relate its usability to a case scenario that we came up with.

• Presented the information learned in a concise written report and a verbal presentation.
